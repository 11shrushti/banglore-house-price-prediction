The Bangalore House Price Prediction project aims to provide an accurate estimate of house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. Bangalore, being one of the major IT hubs of India, has a diverse and dynamic real estate market. Predicting house prices in such a market involves understanding various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other amenities. This project leverages these factors to build a predictive model that can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.
