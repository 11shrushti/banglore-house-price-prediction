# banglore-house-price-prediction
The Bangalore House Price Prediction project aims to provide an accurate estimate of house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. Bangalore, being one of the major IT hubs of India, has a diverse and dynamic real estate market. Predicting house prices in such a market involves understanding various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other amenities. This project leverages these factors to build a predictive model that can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that can help improve the model's performance.
Model Building: Using various regression algorithms to build and train the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction: Providing a user interface or script to input new data and get house price predictions.
Objectives:
To understand the factors influencing house prices in Bangalore.
To build a reliable predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
To provide a tool that can be used by various stakeholders in the real estate market to make better decisions.
